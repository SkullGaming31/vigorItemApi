# Vigor Item API

The Vigor Item API is a RESTful web service that provides access to information about items in the video game Vigor. It allows developers to retrieve detailed data on in-game items such as weapons, consumables, clothing, and more. The API offers endpoints to query item attributes, statistics, rarity, availability, and other relevant information. This data can be used by developers to build companion apps, websites, or tools that provide players with valuable insights and information about the items available in Vigor.

## Project Description

The Vigor Item API is a dedicated RESTful web service that offers access to detailed statistical information about items within the popular video game Vigor. Developed by Bohemia Interactive, Vigor is a free-to-play online shooter game set in a post-apocalyptic Norway, where players scavenge resources, construct shelters, and engage in intense encounters with other players.

The Vigor Item API focuses on providing developers with an extensive database of item statistics from Vigor. These statistics encompass various aspects, including damage values, range, accuracy, reload times, magazine capacities, and other relevant numerical data that impact gameplay mechanics. By making HTTP requests to the API's endpoints, developers can retrieve specific item statistics or perform advanced queries to filter and sort items based on different criteria.

The API serves as a valuable resource for developers aiming to create companion apps, websites, or tools that enhance the Vigor gaming experience by providing detailed insights into item performance. With access to the item statistics database, developers can build features such as weapon comparison tools, damage calculators, loadout optimizers, and other analytical applications. These tools can empower players to make informed decisions about their in-game strategies, fine-tune their loadouts, and gain a deeper understanding of item performance.

By leveraging the Vigor Item API, developers can significantly streamline their development efforts by utilizing a reliable and up-to-date source of item statistics. The API's comprehensive coverage ensures that developers have access to the latest statistical data, enabling them to create applications that stay relevant and valuable to Vigor players.

In summary, the Vigor Item API focuses on providing detailed statistical information about items in the Vigor video game. Developers can leverage this API to create applications that offer insights and analysis related to item performance, helping players optimize their strategies and make informed decisions within the game.

## Installation

Prerequisites
Before proceeding with the installation, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

API Key: Obtain an API key from the Vigor Item API provider. This key is necessary for authenticating and accessing the API endpoints.

HTTP Client: You'll need an HTTP client to make requests to the Vigor Item API. You can use tools like cURL, Postman, or a programming language library such as axios or requests to interact with the API.

Installation and Setup
To install and set up the Vigor Item API project, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository: Begin by cloning the Vigor Item API repository from the provider's GitHub or downloading the source code in a ZIP file.

Install Dependencies: Navigate to the project directory and install any necessary dependencies. This step typically involves using a package manager like npm or yarn. Run the following command to install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Configuration: Configure the API key in your project. This involves creating a configuration file (e.g., config.js or .env) and storing the API key securely. Ensure that the configuration file is properly ignored if sharing the code publicly.

Testing the API: Verify the installation and setup by making a test request to the Vigor Item API. Use your chosen HTTP client to send a GET request to one of the available API endpoints, such as /items or /items/{name} or /weapons/${name} Ensure that you include the API key as part of the request headers or query parameters for authentication.

list of endpoints, all endpoints have a {name} endpoint to search for a single item
```ts
/items or /items/:name
/weapons or /weapons/:name
/tools or /tools/:name
/traps or /traps/:name
/consumables or /consumables/:name
/melee or /melee/:name
/throwables or /throwables/:name
```

Javascript Example using Axios
```js
const axios = require('axios');

const items = 'https://example.com/api/v1/items';// no url for the API as of yet

const response = await axios.get(items)

const jsonData = response.data

console.log(jsonData);
```

Typescript Example using Axios:
```ts
import axios from 'axios';

const weapon = 'https://example.com/api/v1/weapons';

const response = await axios.get(weapon);
const jsonData = response.data;

console.log(jasonData)
```


With these steps, you should have the Vigor Item API installed and set up, ready to retrieve item statistics and integrate them into your project as needed. Remember to refer to the API documentation for detailed information on available endpoints, request formats, and response structures

Usage
To use the Vigor Item API project effectively, follow these guidelines:

Making API Requests: Use your preferred HTTP client, such as cURL, Postman, or a programming language library, to make requests to the Vigor Item API endpoints. The base URL for the API will depend on the provider's documentation.

Endpoint Documentation: Refer to the Vigor Item API documentation for detailed information on available endpoints, request formats, and response structures. The documentation will provide you with a comprehensive list of endpoints you can query to retrieve item statistics.

Example API Requests: Here are some example API requests to get you started:


Retrieve details of all weapons:
```ts
import axios from 'axios'

const response = await axios.get('https://example.com/api/v1/weapons')
console.log(reponse.data)
```

Search for weapon based on name:
```ts
import axios from 'axios'

const response = await axios.get('https://example.com/api/v1/weapons/{name}')
console.log(reponse.data)
```

Retrieve details of all consumables:
```ts
import axios from 'axios'

const response = await axios.get('https://example.com/api/v1/consumables')
console.log(reponse.data)
```

Integration: Integrate the retrieved item statistics into your application's logic as needed. Utilize the data to enhance your gaming experience, analyze item performance, or provide insights to Vigor players.

Additional Resources: If you require further assistance or need more information, consult the Vigor Item API provider's documentation or resources. They may offer additional examples, code snippets, or tutorials to help you effectively utilize the API.

Remember to adhere to the Vigor Item API's terms of use and any rate limits or usage restrictions specified by the provider
